For the time being, virt-v2v requires the xorg lens in this directory in order
to work. The updated lens has been submitted upstream (see
augeas-devel@redhat.com 30/07/2009-31/07/2009). This directory should be removed
on the release of a version of augeas including this file.

Until this lens is included in a released package, it is only usable by
replacing the installed version in /usr/share/augeas/lenses/dist/xorg.conf on
your host system, and using the supermin appliance.
