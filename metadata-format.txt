virt-v2v uses its own representation of a domain's metadata. It is based on, but
differs significantly from, the XML representation used by libvirt.

%
  name          The name of the domain
  memory        The memory assigned to the domain, in bytes
  cpus          The number of cpus assigned to the domain
  arch          The architecture of the domain (eg i686,x86_64)
  features[]    An array containing 'features', as defined by libvirt
  disks[]       An array containing hashrefs of disk descriptions
    device          The name of the disk as seen by the guest (eg sda)
    path            The path to the device's storage, as known to the source
                      or target hypervisor. This will probably not be a valid
                      local path
    (local_path)    A local path to the device's storage, as usable by
                      libguestfs during conversion. This is populated by
                      copy_storage()
    is_block        1 if the device uses block storage, 0 if it uses a file.
    format          The file format used by the underlying storage, as known to
                      qemu (eg raw,qcow)
  removables[]  An array containing hashrefs of removable media devices
    device          The name of the device, as seen by the guest (eg fd0)
    type            The device type, as defined by libvirt (eg floppy,cdrom)
  nics[]        An array containing hashrefs of NIC descriptions
    mac             The mac address
    vnet            The name of the virtual network the NIC will connect to
    vnet_type       The type of virtual network the NIC will connect to, as
                      defined by libvirt (eg network,bridge)
